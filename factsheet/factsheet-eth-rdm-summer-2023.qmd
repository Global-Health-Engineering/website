## Data Management Strategy

![](img/ghe-rdm-workflow.jpg){width=60%}

# Characteristics

## Data at Global Health Engineering

-   small (few MBs)
-   tabular
-   non-sensitive
-   topics (waste management, sanitation, air quality, etc.)
    
# Pain Points

## Lost and overwhelmed

- terminology (underlying data, raw data, processed data, metadata, open sources, open access, ...)
- licensing (CC-BY, MIT, public domain, code, data)
- security & privacy (phone numbers, GPS locations of houses)
- repositories (documentation, upload, maintenance)

## Computational tools

- intimidating
- hard
- not everyone's business

## Scientist as a lone ranger

- acts alone (until becoming a manager/professor)
- exposure to tools (100s throughout research career at different institutions)
- own stack of tools (builds their own individual worksflows -> not team oriented)
- the way to do it (doesn't have time to learn what would be most effective for a team)
