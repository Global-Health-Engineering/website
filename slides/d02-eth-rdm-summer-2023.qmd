::: {.notes}
- acts alone (until becoming a manager/professor)
- exposure to tools (100s throughout research career at different institutions)
- own stack of tools (builds their own individual worksflows -> not team oriented)
- the way to do it (doesn't have time to learn what would be most effective for a team)
