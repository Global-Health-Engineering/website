## Measure 1: Calls for Field-Specific Actions

- 11 calls for proposals
- X projects (A Contribute, B Explore, C Establish)
- X.X million CHF in funding

## Program evaluation {.scrollable .smaller}

::: incremental

- Who are the researchers?
- Which institutions are they employed at?
- Which disciplines do they represent?
- What is their scientific role (e.g. Professor, Post Doc, PhD, etc.)?
- How many publications are derived from these projects?
- How many ORD datasets have been published?
- How where budgets distributed among their cost categories?
- How many proposals were submitted to each call? And how many received funding?

## Problem statement

A metadata dataset that brings together all the information from the ETH ORD programme is currently not available. 

## Proposed solution

Project relevant internal data sources (e.g. submitted proposals, final scientific reports, MS Excel files) will be used to prepare a set of metadata datasets. 

## Make it Open and FAIR

In the spirit of ORD, the metadata datasets will be shared as open research data, following FAIR principles for data sharing.

- permissive license (CC0)
- assigned DOIs
- rich documentation
- various formats (e.g. CSV, XLSX, R data package)
- curated (stand-alone website)
- etc.

::: speaker-notes
- Findable
  - unique identifiers (e.g. DOIs)
  - metadata
  - persistent URLs
- Accessible
  - open access
  - no login required
  - no restrictions on use
- Interoperable
  - machine-readable
  - standard formats (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML)
  - standard vocabularies (e.g. schema.org)
- Reusable
  - clear usage rights
  - clear provenance
  - clear licensing
  - clear attribution

## SNFS Grants database

Not FAIR, but open:

# Datasets

At minimum, the following datasets are suggested, which can be combined by unique identifier (proposal_id):

## Dataset: `proposals` {.scrollable .smaller}

- call_id
- call_category
- proposal_id
- proposal_url (if proposal is public somehere)
- acronym
- title
- abstract
- funding_requested
- funding_received
- panel_score_excellence_reviewer1
- panel_score_implementation_reviewer1
- panel_score_impact_reviewer1
- panel_score_excellence_reviewer2
- panel_score_implementation_reviewer2
- panel_score_impact_reviewer2
- acceptance (yes/no)
- main_applicant_name (if too for rejected proposals, remove from ORD data, but keep internal resource)
- main_applicant_institution_name
- main_applicant_department_name
- main_applicant_lab_name
- co_applicant_name (if too for rejected proposals, remove from ORD data, but keep internal resource)
- co_applicant_institution_name
- co_applicant_department_name
- co_applicant_lab_name

## Dataset: `proposals` - Sources

- Project proposals (accepted & rejected)
- Internal MS Excel files for scores

**Note:** If access to rejected proposals is not possible, a fourth dataset `calls` is suggested.
 
## Dataset: `projects` {.scrollable .smaller}
 
- proposal_id
- project_start
- project_end
- no_cost_extension
- project_website
- budget_cost_category_senior_staff
- budget_cost_category_postdocs
- budget_cost_category_students
- budget_cost_category_other
- budget_cost_category_publications
- budget_cost_category_conferences_workshops
- budget_cost_category_other
- budget_sub_contracting_costs
- etc.

## Dataset: `projects` - Sources

- Project proposals
- Scientific reports

## Dataset: `outputs` {.scrollable .smaller}

- proposal_id
- category (e.g. website, publication, dataset, software, etc.)
- repository_catalogue
- etc.

## Dataset: `outputs` - Sources

- Scientific reports, list of outputs

## Dataset: `calls` {.scrollable .smaller}

A summary table:

- call_id
- call_category
- outcome_total (e.g. accepted, rejected)
- value
