<p>As a freshly employed senior scientist at Global Health Engineering, part of my role is coordinating the multitude of student projects we offer each semester. Our students are engaged in a range of vital research projects related to human health across several African countries. For instance, over the past two years GHE students have partnered with Sistema Bio in Kenya to design and test the use of biogas for the thermal disinfection of wastewater. And, although as a mechanical engineer I have been able to evaluate and advise on this work, one problem remains - I have never been to Kenya and I’ve never personally engaged with the problems we are trying to help address. What’s the best way to address this professional shortcoming? Although we are all trying to reduce our personal carbon emissions, Zoom calls can only get you so far - sometimes you have to travel to learn.</p>
<p>In September 2023 I had the privilege to travel to Kenya with my supervisor Prof.&nbsp;Tilley to connect with our biogas project partners. My journey in Kenya allowed me to engage with a variety of individuals from diverse backgrounds who all enriched my own understanding of Kenya and its socio-​technical challenges. This included learners and educators at schools in Kiababu and Ikinu, a Meru University of Science and Technology professor<sup>1</sup>, and entrepreneurs in Kisumu<sup>2</sup> made. The enthusiasm of students and educators was contagious; I was impressed by their dedication to learning. Apart from all the engaging and meaningful exchanges, I also stirred cubic meters of human waste for the first time in my life. Again, Zoom is a useful tool, but standing together and getting your hands dirty trying to solve a problem can bring the answer much quicker. With all of the partners in the same space, learning together, we were able to identify issues with the biogas installation, found clear paths for further development, and devised a sustainable plan for future collaboration to scale up our findings nationally.</p>
<p>By accident, at the same time as our stay in Kenya, the first Africa Climate Summit<sup>3</sup> took place, bringing around 30 - 35 thousand visitors to Nairobi. I had a chance to exchange with the Summit’s participants. The opportunity was invaluable and provided additional context for framing my work. After the Covid-​19 pandemic, everyone got used to virtual meetings and remote working, but the trip reminded me that travel, and the experiences that come with it, can be invaluable. Although you may collaborate from a distance, in-​person interactions can provide immediate answers to problems which otherwise would take long days to understand through a chain of email exchanges. In retrospect, my first trip to Kenya was a rich and diverse experience, both professionally and personally. I departed with an intent to return, and a clearer vision of how I can support both my students and our Kenyan partners. Moreover, I left Kenya with a profound sense of appreciation for its culture, as well as hope for its future to be brighter. Although I may have returned to Zurich, to a calendar full of online meetings, I’m already thinking ahead to my next trip.<br>

  <title>In an era of open science, how is ‘transparency’ shifting within qualitative research</title>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog post was published is a re-published version from the <a href="https://ghe.ethz.ch/ghe-blog-news/2023/09/in-an-era-of-open-science-how-is-transparency-shifting-within-qualitative-research.html">Global Health Engineering website</a>.

<p>Qualitative research is inherently not reproducible or replicable, a fact those with a more positivist view of knowledge creation find hard to digest. Reproducibility means obtaining consistent results using the same protocol and data, while replicability entails obtaining the same results using the same methods but with different data or a different sample. When using interpretive qualitative methods (which rely on the co-creation of knowledge between researcher and respondent), both the study conditions and the results obtained can hinge on a variety of factors, not least of all, the positionality of the individual researcher. Simply put: when you ask someone a question, you are not guaranteed the same response I might receive.</p>
<p>Therefore, within qualitative research it is more common to speak of transparency, rather than reproducibility or replicability, when evaluating the scientific rigour of a given piece of work. And, while the broader scientific community has moved towards increased openness with data and analysis, there has been a growing debate within qualitative research communities on how much transparency is necessary or possible within current praxis. Sebastian Karcher<sup>1</sup> of the <a href="https://qdr.syr.edu/">Qualitative Data Repository</a> has helpfully distinguished between three three types of transparency most relevant in qualitative research.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Production transparency:</strong> Information on how a study generates or collects data. This can include an interview schedule, and the types of methodological detail that would flesh out a good methods section, such as sample, subject recruitment, exclusion criteria, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Analytic transparency:</strong> Information on how data is prepared and analysed.</li>
<li><strong>Data access:</strong> Data availability, including access conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these forms, the first two have become increasingly <em>de rigueur</em>, with detailed methods sections becoming expected, and information on analysis, including codebooks, becoming increasingly common as supplementary submissions to articles. However, data transparency, including open use and access for qualitative material, especially within the social sciences, has lagged far behind other disciplines where open access is increasingly becoming the standard. There are practical reasons for this, because, as Sebastian Karcher notes, transparency within qualitative research is not a straightforward path, and is often fraught with ethical considerations and practical barriers. What are we doing at Global Health Engineering (GHE) to move this discussion forward and become more transparent in our own work?</p>
<p>At GHE we have made a pledge to embrace the full spectrum of transparency: to make all of our data, either quantitative or qualitative, open access under permissive licenses, and to publicly document how it has been produced and analysed<sup>2</sup>. This is, of course, important, so that the rigour of our research practice can be clearly evaluated, and so that our data can be accessible to other researchers, who may favour other modes of analysis, allowing the words of our respondents to resonate further and make an impact beyond what we may have foreseen.</p>
<p>Through our partnership with the <a href="https://openwashdata.org/">openwashdata</a> team we recently published <a href="https://openwashdata.github.io/biogasoutcomesmalawi/">our first open access qualitative dataset</a>: a series of 61 semi-structured interviews with biogas plant owners in southern Malawi <span class="citation" data-cites="schobitz2023biogasoutcomesmalawia">(Schöbitz et al. 2023)</span>. Moving forward, we intend to publish all of our work in similar fashion, but as a qualitative researcher going through this process for the first time, what did I learn from the experience?</p>
<p>First, making our data open access necessitates a change in ethical practice, particularly in how we obtain consent and inform participants on how their responses will be utilised. Will participants be as willing to speak freely if they know their responses will be made public, albeit anonymously? Second, the preparation of qualitative material for open access is an important step– but is time and resource intensive. Even with an in-house ETH data steward who was able to automate some of these processes, the anonymisation and packaging of transcripts is time consuming. Although we were able to devote the time and resources towards publishing the data package, I am concerned about the feasibility for scholars in less-resourced institutional contexts of giving their work the same platform as standards for transparency shift.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we are pleased with the results of our first effort, and invite engagement and feedback from the greater scientific community. Moving forward, what do we want to improve? First, we would like to be more timely with our outputs, with data packages being published soon after they are collected, ensuring their broader usefulness and to support our own published analyses. Second, to date, we have only published transcripts in English. In the future we will also publish transcripts in the language in which the data collection was conducted, so that the un-translated voices of our respondents can stand on their own. Finally, we intend to develop data management guidelines and open source tools to support data preparation processes so that scholars from low-resource contexts can pursue data publishing without regard to material constraints.</p>
<p>The future is hard to predict, but we are hopeful it will be more transparent.</p>
