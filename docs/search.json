    "title": "In an era of open science, how is ‘transparency’ shifting within qualitative research",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: This blog post was published is a re-published version from the Global Health Engineering website. For attribution, please see the Citation information at the end of this post.\nQualitative research is inherently not reproducible or replicable, a fact those with a more positivist view of knowledge creation find hard to digest. Reproducibility means obtaining consistent results using the same protocol and data, while replicability entails obtaining the same results using the same methods but with different data or a different sample. When using interpretive qualitative methods (which rely on the co-creation of knowledge between researcher and respondent), both the study conditions and the results obtained can hinge on a variety of factors, not least of all, the positionality of the individual researcher. Simply put: when you ask someone a question, you are not guaranteed the same response I might receive.\nTherefore, within qualitative research it is more common to speak of transparency, rather than reproducibility or replicability, when evaluating the scientific rigour of a given piece of work. And, while the broader scientific community has moved towards increased openness with data and analysis, there has been a growing debate within qualitative research communities on how much transparency is necessary or possible within current praxis. Sebastian Karcher1 of the Qualitative Data Repository has helpfully distinguished between three three types of transparency most relevant in qualitative research.\n\nProduction transparency: Information on how a study generates or collects data. This can include an interview schedule, and the types of methodological detail that would flesh out a good methods section, such as sample, subject recruitment, exclusion criteria, etc.\nAnalytic transparency: Information on how data is prepared and analysed.\nData access: Data availability, including access conditions.\n\nOf these forms, the first two have become increasingly de rigueur, with detailed methods sections becoming expected, and information on analysis, including codebooks, becoming increasingly common as supplementary submissions to articles. However, data transparency, including open use and access for qualitative material, especially within the social sciences, has lagged far behind other disciplines where open access is increasingly becoming the standard. There are practical reasons for this, because, as Sebastian Karcher notes, transparency within qualitative research is not a straightforward path, and is often fraught with ethical considerations and practical barriers. What are we doing at Global Health Engineering (GHE) to move this discussion forward and become more transparent in our own work?\nAt GHE we have made a pledge to embrace the full spectrum of transparency: to make all of our data, either quantitative or qualitative, open access under permissive licenses, and to publicly document how it has been produced and analysed2. This is, of course, important, so that the rigour of our research practice can be clearly evaluated, and so that our data can be accessible to other researchers, who may favour other modes of analysis, allowing the words of our respondents to resonate further and make an impact beyond what we may have foreseen.\nThrough our partnership with the openwashdata team we recently published our first open access qualitative dataset: a series of 61 semi-structured interviews with biogas plant owners in southern Malawi (Schöbitz et al. 2023). Moving forward, we intend to publish all of our work in similar fashion, but as a qualitative researcher going through this process for the first time, what did I learn from the experience?\nFirst, making our data open access necessitates a change in ethical practice, particularly in how we obtain consent and inform participants on how their responses will be utilised. Will participants be as willing to speak freely if they know their responses will be made public, albeit anonymously? Second, the preparation of qualitative material for open access is an important step– but is time and resource intensive. Even with an in-house ETH data steward who was able to automate some of these processes, the anonymisation and packaging of transcripts is time consuming. Although we were able to devote the time and resources towards publishing the data package, I am concerned about the feasibility for scholars in less-resourced institutional contexts of giving their work the same platform as standards for transparency shift.\nNonetheless, we are pleased with the results of our first effort, and invite engagement and feedback from the greater scientific community. Moving forward, what do we want to improve? First, we would like to be more timely with our outputs, with data packages being published soon after they are collected, ensuring their broader usefulness and to support our own published analyses. Second, to date, we have only published transcripts in English. In the future we will also publish transcripts in the language in which the data collection was conducted, so that the un-translated voices of our respondents can stand on their own. Finally, we intend to develop data management guidelines and open source tools to support data preparation processes so that scholars from low-resource contexts can pursue data publishing without regard to material constraints.\nThe future is hard to predict, but we are hopeful it will be more transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSchöbitz, Lars, Sebastian Camilo Loos, Marc Kalina, Jonathan Olal Ogwang, Jonathan Kwangulero, and Elizabeth Tilley. 2023. “Biogasoutcomesmalawi: Data for 61 Semi-Structured Interviews with Biogas Owners in Malawi.” https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8289621.\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis is a great blog post by Open Working summing up a presentation by Sebastian Karcher at TU Delft on the limits of reproducibility within qualitative research: https://openworking.wordpress.com/2019/02/11/what-does-reproducibility-mean-for-qualitative-research/↩︎\nLearn more about how we do this in this interview with Dr. Julian Dederke of the ETH Library: https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/news-and-events/internal-news/archive/2023/03/interview-eine-vision-fuer-open-science-and-data-stewardship-an-der-eth-zuerich.html↩︎\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@misc{kalina2023,\n  author = {Kalina, Marc},\n  title = {In an Era of Open Science, How Is “Transparency” Shifting\n    Within Qualitative Research},\n  date = {2023-06-21},\n  url = {https://ghe.ethz.ch/ghe-blog-news.html},\n  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.8318442},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKalina, Marc. 2023. “In an Era of Open Science, How Is\n‘Transparency’ Shifting Within Qualitative\nResearch.” Global Health Engineering Blog. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8318442."

    "text": "We are committed to Open Science. It is a movement aimed at making scientific research more accessible, inclusive, and transparent. Our vision is that all our research output is reproducible. To ensure this, it is our mission to foster an Open Science culture and empower students, researchers, and staff with tools and workflows that enable open data and open code.\nOur tactics achieve this by:\n\nholding a 3-hour Quarterly team event, which discusses and integrates elements of Open Science\nteaching courses at ETH that build competencies in research design, research data management, scientific communication and computational tools (R, Quarto, Git, GitHub)\ncontributing to networks, communities, and working groups for Open Science and reproducibility\nwriting grant applications that target programmes focused on Open Science\n\nWe have developed a data publishing workflow, which support ideas around next generation metrics. Raw, but analysis-ready data is documented and shared prior to the preparation of scientific articles. Where applicable, data from BSc and MSc projects is published. Every data publication is considered a standalone research output with its unique DOI (digital object identifier) and all contributors, including research support staff (e.g. enumerators, laboratory technicians) are added to publications with their unique ORCID iD.\nThe diagram below highlights the elements and tools of our workflow:\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunciation\nWithin in our group we avoid Email by all means. For management and communication on tasks, we use the GitHub issue tracker and Asana task management tool. For instant communication, we use the Matrix chat protocol in combination with Element. For anyone that is interested to connect with us on Open Science, we provide an open room on Element that can be accessed and joined at: https://matrix.to/#/#ghe-open:staffchat.ethz.ch\n\n\n\n\nAdd Mian’s content.\n\n\n\nOpen JMP - unlocking the potential of global indicator data\n\nProject start: 2023-01-05\nProject duration: 12 months\nProject lead: Global Health Engineering\nFunding: Open Research Data Program of the ETH Board\nFunding: 30,000 CHF\n\nDecades of manual data structuring have resulted in the most comprehensive and internationally-comparable information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) coverage. The databases are maintained by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) and data are shared in spreadhsheet-based proprietary software. This under utilizes the potential those data could have for other purposes than the national, regional and global monitoring of progress in WASH mandated to the JMP.\nThe project has three Work Packages, which can be summarised as follows.\nI have analyzed the attached project proposal in Markdown format[1]. Here is a concise three-bullet summary of each work package:\n\n\n\nGoal: Make JMP input data readily accessible for researchers and practitioners.\nMain output: An R data package with detailed documentation, metadata, codebooks, and a public website.\nActivities: Write documentation, prepare use cases as vignettes, publish data and documentation as an R package, and create a public website.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Develop open-source software for transparent documentation of modeling activities for primary indicators.\nMain output: An R software package with complete documentation and a public website.\nActivities: Collaborate with JMP team to replicate production of basic indicators, prepare R functions for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization, write documentation, and publish R functions as a software package.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Seek active collaboration on package development to increase potential usage and long-term maintenance of data and software package.\nMain output: Increased community engagement and dissemination of developed products.\nActivities: Continuously update JMP team on progress, host two public participatory live coding online workshops to showcase developed R packages from WP1 and WP2.\n\nRead the full funded proposal, including Project Plan and Work Packages here: https://github.com/openwashdata/proposal-eth-ord-scheme-contribute/blob/main/proposal-eth-ord-scheme-contribute.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Beyond the Lab: Open Science and Research Methods for a Global Engineer\nOffered for the first time in 2022, we will teach a revised version of this course in spring 2024. We designed this course to teach learners how to conduct a research project out of the lab, and apply Open Science principles to their data analysis projects.\nOver the course of the semester, students will develop a research project and learn the necessary quantitative methods required to collect data from people. We will use tidyverse R packages to work with data, git and GitHub as tools for version control and collaboration, and Quarto publishing system for scientific writing. By the end of the course, students will have a complete overview of how a typical research project is designed, implemented, analysed, and communicated.\nAll materials are published as Open Educational Resources with permissve licenses through GitHub. For students, these course materials are available as a public website: https://rbtl-fs22.github.io/website/.\n\n\n\nOpen Science Tools - authoring and publishing workflows for collaborative scientific writing\nThis course offers researchers a hands-on opportunity to learn open source tools and platforms that are accessible beyond institutional employment. The participatory live coding teaching technique involves an instructor writing and narrating code as they teach, and inviting learners to write and execute the same code.\nTopics covered include:\n\nScientific communication.\nReproducible research (open research, version control, licensing).\nCollaboration through Git and GitHub.\n\nDuring the course, participants will learn how to use the Quarto file format to prepare various scholarly documents, including slides, scientific articles, books, and websites. Additionally, we will demonstrate how GitHub can serve as both a project management tool and a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.\nWhile the course will introduce commonly used tools in software development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness to new ideas.\nCourse Catalogue: https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=174400&semkez=2023W&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&lang=en Website: https://ost-hs23.github.io/website/ GitHub organisation: https://github.com/ost-hs23/\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, we started offering an Open Science fellowship. The goal of the fellowship is to support students in applying Open Science principles to their research. Students are invited to join our group at ETH for a duration of five months between July and October. The fellowship is offered as part of theETH project mobility students programme.\nThe conditions for application are:\n\nstudent from a university in Africa\nenrolled in MSc. programme\ndata for thesis has already been collected\n\nWe support the fellowship with 20’000 CHF which covers:\n\nflights\naccomodation in Zurich\na monthly stipend of 1750 CHF\nadministrative costs (first monthly ZVV pass, registration)\n\nConditions for application are:\n\nA max 400 word summary covering MSc. thesis objectives, collected data formats, and experience using computational tools (R, Git, GitHub)\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping an Open Science culture within a research group requires addressing and dispelling common misconceptions about Open Science. It also requires opportunities for learning tools and methods to apply Open Science principles. We have incorporated three regular events into our research group’s organizational structure and culture:\n\nWeekly 1-hour event: Weekly event with a shared Google Doc as a notebook. Prior to the event, everyone adds their notes to the Google Doc in four categoires (Doing this week, Done last week, Support needed, Other announcements). This events purpose is to keep everyone in the group aligned updated, but also an opportunity to discuss Open Science elements of individual projects.\nQuarterly 4-hour event: Our Quarterly event allows for work and sharing of group-wide projects. We also invite external speakesr to help us learn more about working together efficiently. Every event has at least one element that addresses Open Science principles.\nYearly 2-day event: We organize an annual 2-day retreat where the research group comes together for an extended period to discuss their work, share best practices, and develop strategies for incorporating Open Science principles into our research.\n\nWhen fostering an Open Science culture, we are confronted with misconceptions around publishing data and code openly with permissive licenses. Some common misconceptions we are tackling in our strategic meetings are:\nMisconception 1: Publishing my data does not benefit anyone\nCounterargument: Publishing research data can benefit both the researcher and the scientific community. Sharing data increases the visibility of the research, potentially leading to more citations and recognition for the researcher. It promotes collaboration and enables other researchers to build upon the existing work, fostering innovation and scientific progress while avoiding ineffiencies.\nMisconception 2: Others may criticize my code\nCounterargument: While it is true that open-source code may be subject to criticism, this can be a positive aspect of Open Science. Constructive criticism can help identify potential issues, improve the code, and contribute to the overall quality of the project.\nMisconception 3: Publishing my content under CC-BY-NC will prevent people from exploiting my content commercially.\nCounterargument: While the CC-BY-NC (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial) license does restrict commercial use of the content, it may also inadvertently limit the potential impact and reach of your work.\nBy using a CC-BY-NC license, you prevent the following use cases:\n\nCommercial use in academic research: Researchers working in collaboration with commercial entities or receiving funding from commercial sources may be unable to use your content, limiting the potential for interdisciplinary research and collaboration.\nCommercial use in educational materials: Publishers of textbooks, online courses, and other educational materials that are sold for profit may be unable to include your content, reducing its potential reach and impact on students and educators.\nCommercial use in software development: Companies developing software or applications that incorporate your content may be unable to do so under a CC-BY-NC license, limiting the potential for innovation and the development of new tools and technologies.\nCommercial use in creative works: Artists, writers, and other creators who wish to incorporate your content into their commercial works may be unable to do so, limiting the potential for your work to inspire and influence others.\n\n\n\n\nWe are actively working on a coherent Data Management Strategy for our group. At this poing, we prepared a strategy for BSc and MSc projects. This so-called GHE students Wiki is publicly available and published using the Atlassian Confluence tool, for which ETH covers a license agreement."

    "text": "Research Beyond the Lab: Open Science and Research Methods for a Global Engineer\nOffered for the first time in 2022, we will teach a revised version of this course in spring 2024. We designed this course to teach learners how to conduct a research project out of the lab, and apply Open Science principles to their data analysis projects.\nOver the course of the semester, students will develop a research project and learn the necessary quantitative methods required to collect data from people. We will use tidyverse R packages to work with data, git and GitHub as tools for version control and collaboration, and Quarto publishing system for scientific writing. By the end of the course, students will have a complete overview of how a typical research project is designed, implemented, analysed, and communicated.\nAll materials are published as Open Educational Resources with permissve licenses through GitHub. For students, these course materials are available as a public website: https://rbtl-fs22.github.io/website/.\n\n\n\nOpen Science Tools - authoring and publishing workflows for collaborative scientific writing\nThis course offers researchers a hands-on opportunity to learn open source tools and platforms that are accessible beyond institutional employment. The participatory live coding teaching technique involves an instructor writing and narrating code as they teach, and inviting learners to write and execute the same code.\nTopics covered include:\n\nScientific communication.\nReproducible research (open research, version control, licensing).\nCollaboration through Git and GitHub.\n\nDuring the course, participants will learn how to use the Quarto file format to prepare various scholarly documents, including slides, scientific articles, books, and websites. Additionally, we will demonstrate how GitHub can serve as both a project management tool and a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.\nWhile the course will introduce commonly used tools in software development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness to new ideas.\nCourse Catalogue: https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=174400&semkez=2023W&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&lang=en Website: https://ost-hs23.github.io/website/ GitHub organisation: https://github.com/ost-hs23/"

    "text": "Developing an Open Science culture within a research group requires addressing and dispelling common misconceptions about Open Science. It also requires opportunities for learning tools and methods to apply Open Science principles. We have incorporated three regular events into our research group’s organizational structure and culture:\n\nWeekly 1-hour event: Weekly event with a shared Google Doc as a notebook. Prior to the event, everyone adds their notes to the Google Doc in four categoires (Doing this week, Done last week, Support needed, Other announcements). This events purpose is to keep everyone in the group aligned updated, but also an opportunity to discuss Open Science elements of individual projects.\nQuarterly 4-hour event: Our Quarterly event allows for work and sharing of group-wide projects. We also invite external speakesr to help us learn more about working together efficiently. Every event has at least one element that addresses Open Science principles.\nYearly 2-day event: We organize an annual 2-day retreat where the research group comes together for an extended period to discuss their work, share best practices, and develop strategies for incorporating Open Science principles into our research.\n\nWhen fostering an Open Science culture, we are confronted with misconceptions around publishing data and code openly with permissive licenses. Some common misconceptions we are tackling in our strategic meetings are:\nMisconception 1: Publishing my data does not benefit anyone\nCounterargument: Publishing research data can benefit both the researcher and the scientific community. Sharing data increases the visibility of the research, potentially leading to more citations and recognition for the researcher. It promotes collaboration and enables other researchers to build upon the existing work, fostering innovation and scientific progress while avoiding ineffiencies.\nMisconception 2: Others may criticize my code\nCounterargument: While it is true that open-source code may be subject to criticism, this can be a positive aspect of Open Science. Constructive criticism can help identify potential issues, improve the code, and contribute to the overall quality of the project.\nMisconception 3: Publishing my content under CC-BY-NC will prevent people from exploiting my content commercially.\nCounterargument: While the CC-BY-NC (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial) license does restrict commercial use of the content, it may also inadvertently limit the potential impact and reach of your work.\nBy using a CC-BY-NC license, you prevent the following use cases:\n\nCommercial use in academic research: Researchers working in collaboration with commercial entities or receiving funding from commercial sources may be unable to use your content, limiting the potential for interdisciplinary research and collaboration.\nCommercial use in educational materials: Publishers of textbooks, online courses, and other educational materials that are sold for profit may be unable to include your content, reducing its potential reach and impact on students and educators.\nCommercial use in software development: Companies developing software or applications that incorporate your content may be unable to do so under a CC-BY-NC license, limiting the potential for innovation and the development of new tools and technologies.\nCommercial use in creative works: Artists, writers, and other creators who wish to incorporate your content into their commercial works may be unable to do so, limiting the potential for your work to inspire and influence others."
